# 🎶 Spotify Dashboard – Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This is a **self-interest project** I created to explore and learn **Power BI dashboarding**.  
I used a publicly available **Spotify dataset** (link below) to analyze songs, artists, and their performance across platforms.  
The main goal of this project was to **practice different types of Power BI charts** and understand how to build an **interactive music analytics dashboard**.
